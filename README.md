# One-Stop-Degree-Issuance-System
The Problem that the large number of students have to physically visit the One Stop Office to Request for their Degree Issuance after completion of their final semester creates a hindrance in the operations of the One Stop Office. The impact of which is that the students have to face large queues and have to wait hours to fulfill their concerns that only required few minutes of work by the One Stop Staff. A successful solution to this problem would be the creation of an Online Degree Issuance System for One stop that automates the process and eradicates the need to physically visit the One Stop Office to start oneâ€™s request for degree issuance. The creation of such a system will not only facilitate graduated students to request for their degree issuance without any hassle but also remove the need for them to wait in large queues for their urgent piece of work. In addition to this the system will also allow the FYP and Finance Department to streamline their work and respond to student requests on a single shared platform. Using this system the Administration and the Director will also be able to view and keep a track of all the generated requests that are in either pending, processed or new state.
